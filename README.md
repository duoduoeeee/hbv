Says happy birthday automatically to Luo Tianyi and Yan He, two of the most popular Chinese Vocaloid singers

This script automatically creates a `<div>` element as you specify when a specific date arrives. Time is acquired from your system.

## How to use

- Include `hb.js` provided in this repository in the `<head>` tag of your webpage
- Call `processCurrentDate()` where you need it
- You may want to change the id of the parent div. Remember to setup approperiate css classes and element ids so that the script recognises the page correctly

## "Feelings"

This little project is here because of my pure love to Tianyi and Yan He. They both have their personalities although they are just voicebanks that interact with the Vocaloid compositor to pronounce syllables.
